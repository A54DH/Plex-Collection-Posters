# Plex Collection Posters

This is an open place where we can collectively update and share Plex collection posters that use the same style. I don't take credit for these posters as the original design was done by a Reddit user, link to the [Imgur here](https://imgur.com/a/R2s1T1h). This was continuously another kind stranger in the form of a shared [MEGA link here](https://mega.nz/folder/2IE0gCyC#ulyL5JWhDkfEH5w58PKi2A). The MEGA link works well, but I think it's unfair to rely on a single person to update the posters, which is why this project was created. To allow everyone to create collections that are missing so that everyone can benefit.

To the original creators, I did want to get permission from yourselves first, but your Reddit accounts have been deleted. If you'd like me to remove this project, please do let me know.


## How to create

It's important to note that consistency of the collection is paramount, so please ensure that any artwork you've created uses the templates. All designs should include the name of the film or collection on the artwork, not just an image of the poster (with no text) and the words collection underneath. See existing files if unsure. File naming is also important with the name of the show as the name of the file. If you're designing an alternative version see instructions below.

1. Please download the starter file. The original collection artwork maker again created this, but I've just added a version to download here. I didn't create it, and all credit goes to him/her.

2. Open a program that allows you to work with image layers (Sketch, Photoshop, etc.).

3. Place the collection image at the top of the layers list and place your desired artwork underneath.

4. Export (save) as a jpg and upload to here for everyone else to benefit from too.

### Creating alternative versions

Sometimes an the existing designs doesn't look right, so you might want to create you're own. If so, please use the instructions below to create your designs but then pay close attention to the naming of the file (export). All alternative versions use A# format. A to indicate that this is an alternative version and the # referring to the number as there may be a number of alternative versions.

For example:

Thor.jpg
Thor A1.jpg
Thor A2.jpg

## Requesting collection artwork

If you don't have any design software available or simply don't have time to create them, please submit any design requests as issues. This will allow other people to chip in and create requests when they have the opportunity.

It would also be helpful if you linked any image(s) you want as the background so it's easier to create and you get exactly what you want.

## Finding artwork

I've tried to make it as easy as possible to find what you're looking for. In the collection folder, you'll see some subfolders organised alphabetically. Within these folders, you'll find the artwork for collections, again, organised alphabetically. If you have any suggestions about organising them better, please do let me know.
