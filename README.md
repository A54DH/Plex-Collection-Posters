# Plex Collection Posters

This is an open place where we can collectively update and share Plex collection posters that use the same style. I don't take credit for these posters as the original design was done by a Reddit user, link to the [Imgur here](https://imgur.com/a/R2s1T1h). This was continuously another kind stranger in the form of a shared [MEGA link here](https://mega.nz/folder/2IE0gCyC#ulyL5JWhDkfEH5w58PKi2A). The MEGA link works well, but I think it's unfair to rely on a single person to update the posters, which is why this project was created. To allow everyone to create collections that are missing so that everyone can benefit.

To the original creators, I did want to get permission from yourselves first, but your Reddit accounts have been deleted. If you'd like me to remove this project, please do let me know.


## How to create

1. Please download the starter file. The original collection artwork maker again created this, but I've just added a version to download here. I didn't create it, and all credit goes to him/her.

2. Open a program that allows you to work with image layers (Sketch, Photoshop, etc.).

3. Place the collection image at the top of the layers list and place your desired artwork underneath.

4. Export (save) as a jpg and upload to here for everyone else to benefit from too.

## Finding artwork

I've tried to make it as easy as possible to find what you're looking for. In the collection folder, you'll see some subfolders organised alphabetically. Within these folders, you'll find the artwork for collections, again, organised alphabetically. If you have any suggestions about organising them better, please do let me know.
